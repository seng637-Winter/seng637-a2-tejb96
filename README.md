# 1 Introduction
This exercise involved the implementation of JUnit testing for two Java classes within the Eclipse development environment. The initial steps included configuring the project and incorporating the necessary JFreeChart JAR files. Additionally, participants gained proficiency in navigating the Eclipse environment and became acquainted with setting up and executing JUnit tests.

Furthermore, the team actively engaged with Java Documentation, acquiring the skill to interpret and understand the functionality of the code. This process included delving into the documentation to discern the intentions behind each function as elucidated by the original developer. This comprehensive approach not only facilitated a thorough comprehension of the codebase but also provided insights into the rationale and design choices made by the initial developer.


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

In the absence of detailed insights into the internal workings of the methods under consideration, the team opted for a black-box testing approach as part of their unit test strategy. The initial step involved a meticulous examination of the JavaDoc documentation for the DataUtilities and Range classes, focusing on the specifications outlined for each method. The team then selected five methods from the Range class for testing.

For each method in both classes, the adopted test strategy comprised a systematic approach. The team divided each parameter into two primary equivalence classes - valid and invalid, and further subdivided them into more specific classes. A critical facet of this strategy involved identifying boundary values within each class, applying boundary value analysis. Subsequently, redundant classes were eliminated to streamline the testing process.

To enhance the robustness of the test suite, the team conducted a comprehensive review of the test cases for each method. Any potential gaps in coverage were addressed by adding supplementary test cases, ensuring a thorough and exhaustive examination of the functionality without delving into the internal implementation details. The ensuing section provides a detailed presentation of the test cases developed through this rigorous and systematic testing strategy.

# 3 Test cases developed


**DataUtilitiesTest**

1. `testCreateNumberArray2D`: This test method covers the partition of valid input, ensuring that the method correctly creates a 2D array of Number objects based on the input data.
   
2. `testCreateNumberArray2D_NullInput`: This test method covers the partition of invalid input, specifically when a null array is passed as input, ensuring that the method handles this case gracefully.

3. `testCreateNumberArray2D_EmptyInput`: This test method covers the partition of invalid input, specifically when an empty array is passed as input, ensuring that the method handles this case gracefully.

**RangeTest**

1. `testCombine_NullRanges`: This test method covers the partition of invalid input, specifically when null ranges are passed as input, ensuring that the method handles this case gracefully.

2. `testCombine_EmptyRanges`: This test method covers the partition of invalid input, specifically when empty ranges are passed as input, ensuring that the method handles this case gracefully.

3. `testCombine_DisjointRanges`: This test method covers the partition of valid input, ensuring that the method correctly combines disjoint ranges into a single range.

4. `testCombine_OverlappingRanges`: This test method covers the partition of valid input, ensuring that the method correctly combines overlapping ranges into a single range.

5. `testCombine_AdjacentRanges`: This test method covers the partition of valid input, ensuring that the method correctly combines adjacent ranges into a single range.

These test cases collectively provide thorough coverage of the functionality of the `DataUtilities` and `Range` classes, ensuring that both valid and invalid inputs are handled appropriately according to the specifications outlined in the JavaDoc documentation.


# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

At the project's outset, the team convened for a collaborative session to establish the Eclipse project setup, conduct a collective review of assigned tasks, and acquaint themselves with the process of interpreting Java documentation. Following a comprehensive understanding of the project requirements, individual team members were assigned responsibility for testing two specific methods each, resulting in the examination of a total of 10 methods.

Subsequently, the outcomes of the individual testing efforts underwent a thorough peer review. The collaborative nature of the team's approach is reflected in the joint creation of a comprehensive report for Section 3 of the overall documentation. Furthermore, the distribution of the remaining five sections of the report among the team members ensured a shared and equitable contribution to the documentation process, highlighting the collective effort invested in the successful execution and documentation of the testing procedures.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Navigating the structure of JUnit tests posed an initial challenge, requiring adaptation to its intricacies. The division of work necessitated meticulous coordination to ensure the seamless integration of individual tests into a cohesive whole. Verification of each team member's test functionality, coupled with the task of maintaining a consistent tone across various sections of the report, added an additional layer of complexity.

To mitigate potential discrepancies, a comprehensive peer review process was implemented. This involved scrutinizing each other's code to validate the accurate incorporation of conditions. Subsequently, a designated team member undertook the responsibility of consolidating the diverse sections of the report, ensuring its coherence for readers. This collaborative and iterative approach not only addressed the challenges encountered but also contributed to the production of a unified and well-structured final deliverable.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The laboratory assignment proved to be a valuable exercise in honing our skills in testing through the application of black-box techniques and the utilization of JUnit. This practical experience significantly contributed to the establishment of a robust foundation for both unit testing and mocking practices. The assignment's effectiveness was notably enhanced by the clarity and comprehensiveness of the instructions provided in the assignment description markdown file. This meticulous guidance facilitated a smooth setup process and enabled prompt initiation of the assignment.

Throughout the completion of the assignment, the combination of class teachings and supplementary external resources played a pivotal role in addressing challenges and enhancing our understanding of the testing methodologies. The overall learning experience was commendable, fostering increased confidence among the team in the execution of JUnit testing. The structured nature of the lab, coupled with the supportive resources, collectively contributed to a positive and enriching learning environment.
